## 어플명 먹을래 말래(미확정)

**As I've been in college**  
 I thought the community power of college students was powerful enough not to fall for any group. In other words, I felt the power of the university group in that there was a place where they could communicate with each other in a comfortable relationship every day and meet some spending power.   

**So, I'm going to use these as a target**  
We have planned a lunch and dinner menu recommendation application. Personally, I had a hard time deciding on the lunch and dinner menu easily, and I thought there would be many people like me.

**But it's not just a restaurant recommendation app**  
If you recommend specific menu names such as **Tongjip Sunsalhyeon Mibake** and **Daeseol Porksaegeol** within the special business district of the university district, I think you will be able to sympathize and have fun as a university member.

**It’s still in its early stages**
but I have many fun ideas I’d like to add in the future. I believe that with some refinement and organization, this project could attract great interest upon release. Not all university members are familiar with popular restaurants near campus, so the app could also serve as a useful information-sharing tool. Additionally, it could help resolve situations where opinions are divided when choosing where to eat within a group. I believe it’s an app that can be used easily and accessibly by anyone.

**Let's launch it at JBNU** 
If the response is good, we are even considering collaborating with other universities and spreading to restaurants where many companies are concentrated.
