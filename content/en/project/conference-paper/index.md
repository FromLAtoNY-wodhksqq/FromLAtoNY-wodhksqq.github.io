I developed a bank account transaction inquiry service program using the C language in a Linux environment. This program allows users to securely input their bank account information and efficiently view and manage their deposit and withdrawal history.

In particular, it utilizes file input/output and structures (structs) to systematically store transaction records for each account and enables quick searches when needed. The program also provides a user-friendly menu system, allowing users to easily navigate through key functions such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history inquiries. It is designed with robust error handling to properly manage invalid inputs or unexpected situations.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in system programming, file management, struct-based data handling, and user interface design within a Linux environment. Additionally, it deepened my understanding of data management and security handling in software development.
